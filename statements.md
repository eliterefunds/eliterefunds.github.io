>It will be possible to have a single player game without connecting to the galaxy server. You won't get the features of the evolving galaxy (although we will investigate minimising those differences) and you probably won't be able to sync between server and non-server (again we'll investigate). [Kickstarter FAQ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous/description#project_faq_43734)


>"Elite will also work offline but you just won't get a lot of the features. The whole point is that the world evolves due to the aggregated actions of the players." -- [David Braben](http://www.edge-online.com/news/frontiers-david-braben-on-bringing-elite-dangerous-to-next-gen-consoles/)

>"I'm always concerned with games that are server-based that you can't then play them after the publisher or whoever turns the servers off. We'll structure it in a way that you could play it entirely locally, so it would survive time if that makes sense." - [David Braben](http://archive.beefjack.com/index.html%3Fp=155940.html#sthash.fq4vY83b.dpuf)

>"We plan to fund the servers off (i) the updates and (ii) people who want to buy cash. I don't think it is a high risk - and in the worst case we will structure the game so that it can be run without the servers should we eventually have to shut them down." - David Braben

>"I hope you'll all give the connected game a try as it is the way we want people to experiece it, but you have the option if it's not your thing." - [Michael Brookes](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2913&page=8&p=29549&viewfull=1#post29549)

>"You can play offline without server connections and we will make sure you can play the game if we ever shut the servers down." - [Michael Brookes](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous/posts/376335?cursor=1998331#comment-1998330)

>"Space is big :-) Most of the galaxy is unexplored when the game begins and there are plenty of resources to be discovered.  There will also be an offline single player mode." - [Michael Brookes](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15od2s/i_am_david_braben_cocreator_of_elite_creator_of/c7ochfo)
