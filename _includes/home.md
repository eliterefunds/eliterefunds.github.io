#Summary

In [Newsletter #49](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&id=6b99a1d038), Frontier Developments made a single sentence statement concerning offline mode toward the end of David Braben's Development section:

>A fully offline experience would be unacceptably limited and static compared to the dynamic, ever unfolding experience we are delivering.

This would be the first time in almost 2 years from the Kickstarter project, that anyone outside of Frontier Developments would hear what, David Braben called 5 days later in [Newsletter #50](http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&id=cea4f4cd56), was a "creative decision" to forever cease all intention of supporting offline play.

In the span of those 5 days, unknown numbers of backers and customers requested refunds.  There was no coherent official reply.  The forum exploded with activity.  It got worse when the official refund policy was outlined in [Newsletter #50](http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&id=cea4f4cd56):

>- Those who have pre-ordered an Elite: Dangerous release version from our online store and have therefore not yet played the game are eligible for a refund.
>- Those who have already been playing the game online in the Alpha and/or Beta phases, regardless of whether they backed the project via Kickstarter or purchased access to Alpha and/or Beta through our online store, are not eligible for a refund.

One forum thread hit the 10k post limit and was continued in a second thread before being closed by moderators after 2k+ more posts; further discussion on the topic was squelched by some moderators deleting posts en-masse.

The refund policy was modified again to be a "case-by-case review".  Replies to refund requests were either flat refusals or partial refunds with unspecified reasoning; only a few have received full refunds.

Customers/backers are left to decide if the hassle of pushing for what is due is worth the effort necessary to *encourage* Frontier to do the right and fair thing.

#TL:DR;
>Frontier Developments is simply refusing to meet several of its project commitments, and has stated several times in multiple public channels that the decision is largely, if not completely, based on their 'vision' of the project.
>
>Their 'vision' was not a mystery nor was it ambiguous. It was known to them long before they chose to pursue Kickstarter-based funding. And they consciously declared a commitment to several core characteristics during that campaign in order to secure funding. If they feel those characteristics compromise their 'vision', then they shouldn't have included them in the campaign. But they moment they *DID*, they amended their vision to include them as well, and are not at liberty to opt out at the 11th hour.
